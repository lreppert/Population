# Population
This was an assignment from my professor 
The program prompts you for three inputs, First is the 
number of periods/iteration, Second is the Beginning prey population,
Third is the beginning Predator population. It then will model the population based on 
the iterations. It will display the output for every period.

Java Programming
How to use the Population Modeler. This is designed to be used with whole positive numbers as the outputs are nonsense when using non whole or negative numbers. Exhibit A and B are examples of using non whole and negative numbers for the Number of Periods.

 

The first input asked for is the number of periods/iterations: 

Type the number of periods you would like to evaluate then hit enter: for example I entered 10.
Then it prompts us to enter the beginning number of Prey Population.
 
Type the Initial prey population and then hit enter: for example I entered 1000.
Then it prompts us to enter the beginning number of Predator Population.
 
Type the Initial predator population and then hit enter: for example I entered 20.
Then it will evaluate and iterate and display the values for each Period. 
The Data has been formatted so it should consistently be very readable even over great period values.
Large period values may generate â€“infinity based on the initial inputs of prey and predator populations.
